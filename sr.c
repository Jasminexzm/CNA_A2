   Go Back N protocol.  Adapted from J.F.Kurose
   ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.2  

   Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
   are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
   or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
   (although some can be lost).

   Modifications: 
   - removed bidirectional GBN code and other code not used by prac. 
   - fixed C style to adhere to current programming style
   - added GBN implementation

   In this practical this will always be an ACK as B never sends data.

  This function handles the ACKs received from receiver B.
  Unlike Go-Back-N, where a cumulative ACK causes the sender to slide its window all at once,
  Selective Repeat treats each ACK independently. Therefore:
  
  1. We first check whether the ACK is corrupted.
  2. Then we verify if the ACK falls within the current sender window.
     Since sequence numbers wrap around in SR, we need to account for circular indexing.
  3. If the ACK is valid and hasn't been seen before:
     - We mark the corresponding packet as acknowledged in the buffer.
     - If it ACKs the base of the window (windowfirst), we try to advance the window.
       This is done by checking how many consecutive ACKs (starting from base) weâ€™ve received.
       We then shift the buffer, update the window start pointer, and restart the timer.
  4. If the ACK is a duplicate (already marked), we simply ignore it.
  5. If the ACK is not for the base but within the window, we still mark it as acknowledged.
     It may help slide the window later when earlier packets get ACKed.
